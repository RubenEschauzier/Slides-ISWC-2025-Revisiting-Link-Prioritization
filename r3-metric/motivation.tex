\begin{frame}{$R^{3}$ metric: Motivation}
    \begin{block}{Context}
        During link traversal, the engine traverses a fixed topology entirely
    \end{block}

    \begin{block}{Goal}
        The goal of prioritization is to find query-relevant (\emph{where-provenance}) documents as soon as possible.
    \end{block}

  \begin{alertblock}{Challenge}
        Find the \textbf{optimal traversal order} of a given query in hindsight to compare the traversal order taken by the engine to.
