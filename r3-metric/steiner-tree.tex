\begin{frame}{$R^{3}$ metric: Steiner trees}
    \begin{itemize}
        \item The problem of finding the optimal traversal order can be translated to solving the directed graph steiner tree problem.
        \item The traversed topology admits directed graph $G = (V, A)$ with root $r$
        \item Query-relevant documents $D_{T}$ serve as terminals $T \subseteq V$
        \item Find minimum cost sub-graph $X = (V', A')$ starting at root $r$ and spanning all vertexes $T$.
        \item With cost: $ C(X) = \sum\nolimits_{a \in A'} c(a), $, with $c(a)$ the cost of an edge in the topology
    \end{itemize}
