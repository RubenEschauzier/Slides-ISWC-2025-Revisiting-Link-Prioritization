    \centering
    Investigate the performance of link prioritization algorithms in literature in new structured decentralized environments
\end{frame}

\begin{frame}{Problem Statement}
    \begin{itemize}
        \item These algorithms are implemented in an engine that is no longer maintained
        \item The baseline performance depends on design choices orthogonal to the prioritization algorithm
        \item The baseline should measure marginal prioritization performance
        \item We introduce the $R^{3}$ metric
    \end{itemize}
